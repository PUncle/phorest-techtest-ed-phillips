# Phorest tech test - Ed Phillips

[https://phorest-techtest-ed-phillips.netlify.com/](https://phorest-techtest-ed-phillips.netlify.com/)

This is a Nuxt.js Vue app. The parts you will most likely be interested in are located in the `/pages/` and `/components/` directories.

> Show us examples of 2-3 patterns you feel important to building an application like this and we will use them to drive the discussion whileÂ reviewing the test with you.

## Requirements

You'll need a `.env` file in the root of this project for it to work with the following variables:

``` text
NUXT_ENV_BASIC_AUTH_USER=
NUXT_ENV_BASIC_AUTH_PASS=
NUXT_ENV_BUSINESS_ID=
NUXT_ENV_BRANCH_ID=
NUXT_ENV_API_BASE=https://api-gateway-dev.phorest.com/third-party-api-server/api
```

I used the details provided in the tech test description.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# test
$ npm run test
```
